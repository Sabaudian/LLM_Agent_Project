This project builds a RAG agent using LangChain, LangGraph, and an open-source LLM from Ollama. 
It retrieves travel-related information by crawling a website, stores the data in a Chroma vector database, and uses Nomic embeddings for document processing. 
The result is a travel planner advisor that provides personalized travel suggestions.
