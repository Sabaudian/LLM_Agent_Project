This project builds a travel advisor system using LangChain, LangGraph, and an open-source LLM from Ollama. 
Retrieves travel-related information by crawling a website pages, stores the data in a Chroma vector database, and uses Nomic embeddings for document processing. 
The result is a travel planning tool that provides personalized travel suggestions.
